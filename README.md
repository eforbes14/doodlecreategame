The player travels on a pencil (different skins can be unlocked - more about that later). Each level/section is a request from a citizen in the playerâ€™s town to build something that could help them (ex: request from a kid to draw stairs so they can reach their toy, the governor requesting that a building is built/drawn). There are certain rules for each creation, but it is very free from there. After each successful level, the player is rewarded with a certain amount of coins based on the difficulty of the drawing. The player can use these coins to get more skins for their pencil/way of travel and drawing. For example, a skin could be a pen or a quill.
